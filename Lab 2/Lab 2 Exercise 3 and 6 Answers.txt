Exercise #3:
d) 
'inx' is not a variable type, should be 'int'
'int a = 3;' semicolon should be replaced with comma
'Double' should be 'double'
printf (The value of d is %d"\n, d) should be printf ("The value of d is %lf\n", d);, %lf is used for doubles, unfinished quotations and \n should be inside the quotes
'e', 'c', 'f' are not used therefore can be removed
e)
The runtime error is that there are unused variables 
The logical error is that c = 3 / (4 - 4) which results in dividing by 0 
g)
The value of d is 7.000000

Exercise #6:
1) char is a keyword in C used for characters while Char is not 
2) prints 0
3) not valid, must be type int or 50.0
4) does not compile
5) lf is a double while f is float
6) compiler warning "division by zero
7) not valid cannot use modulo with doubles
8) no there is no difference
9) prints according to ASCII table
10) 5/3=1, 5%3=2, 5.0/3=1.666667, no they are not the same
